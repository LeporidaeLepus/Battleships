- To win the game, click the board to fire the enemy's ships in limit times (which is half the number of boards). 
  - After clicking, the selected board will change its color. If the board is part of a boat, it will change to orange, else it will change to dark green.
- The total number of boards will be generated randomly.
- There will always be at least 1 boat and up to a maximum of 3 in any one game. 
- The length of boats varies in 1-4 spaces and boat sizes and boat dimentions will vary from game to game.

**Scoring:**  You will get 1 point for every whole boat sank, 0.5 points for each boat hit at least once (not including boats that are sunk) and -1 point for each whole boat that was not hit at least once.
